## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Portfolio
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser or use a local development server like Live Server in VSCode.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Create a GitHub repository named `Portfolio`
2. Push your code to the repository:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/Portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Go to repository Settings > Pages
4. Under "Source", select the "main" branch
5. Click "Save"
6. Your site will be published at `https://your-username.github.io/Portfolio/`

### Troubleshooting GitHub Pages

If your site doesn't load properly on GitHub Pages:

1. **Check the CSS/JS paths**: Ensure all paths in your HTML file use relative paths with `./` prefix (like `./css/main.css` instead of `/css/main.css`)
2. **Verify .nojekyll file**: Make sure the `.nojekyll` file exists in your repository root to disable Jekyll processing
3. **Check browser console**: Open your site, press F12 to open DevTools, and check the Console tab for errors
4. **Clear cache**: Try clearing your browser cache or open in Incognito/Private mode
5. **Wait for deployment**: GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update after pushing changes

## üì± Responsive Design

The portfolio is fully responsive and works well on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

## ‚ú® Customization

Feel free to customize the portfolio to match your preferences:

- **Colors:** Edit the CSS variables in the `:root` selector in `css/main.css`
- **Content:** Update your information in the `index.html` file
- **Images:** Replace the placeholder with your actual profile image
- **Projects:** Add or modify project cards in the Projects section
- **Social Links:** Update the links in the Contact section and footer

## üß© Animation Components

The project includes several reusable animation components:

### Background Animation
- Canvas-based particle system with customizable colors and density
- Optional butterfly animation for a unique touch
- Toggle to enable/disable for users who prefer minimal motion

### Scroll Animations
- `<AnimateOnScroll>` - Wrapper component that animates children when scrolled into view
- `<AnimatedText>` - Text that animates by character or word for eye-catching headlines
- Uses Intersection Observer for performance

### Interactive UI Components
- `<AnimatedButton>` - Buttons with various hover effects (scale, glow, etc.)
- `<AnimatedCard>` - Cards with subtle hover animations (tilt, scale, etc.)
- `<AnimatedLink>` - Links with animated underline effects

## üé® Color Scheme

The portfolio uses a refined color palette:

- **Primary**: Indigo (`#6366f1`) - Clean, professional, and modern
- **Secondary**: Violet (`#8b5cf6`) - Adds creative flair
- **Accent**: Blue (`#3b82f6`) - For highlights and CTAs
- **Neutral**: Gray scale - For text and backgrounds
- **Peach**: (`#f97316`) - For subtle accents

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React** - Component-based UI structure
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling approach
- **Framer Motion** - Animation library for smooth transitions
- **React Intersection Observer** - For scroll-based animations

## üì± Performance Considerations

All animations are designed with performance in mind:

- Canvas-based background animations offer better performance than DOM animations
- Animations are hardware-accelerated where possible (`transform`, `opacity`)
- Reduced motion option disables or simplifies animations for users who prefer it
- Lazy loading of heavier animation components

   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
